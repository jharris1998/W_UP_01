The report structure should include five sections.  see below



```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
require(tigerstats)
require(tidyverse)
mydata <- read.csv(file="pushups.csv")
```

# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show. Where did the data come from? What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

Create an Rstudio project in your shared space on rstudio.cloud.  Using the data set called push ups from the tiger stats package in R; answer the question posed by this null and alternate hypothesis in an html markdown document.

$H_0$: There is no difference between the average number of push ups of line vs skill players

$H_A$: The average number of push ups done by line players is statistically different than that of skill players.

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods: use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors. Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections: One for your descriptive results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here. Make sure to show your code. Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too. Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
boxplot(pushups~position,data=mydata)
```

Looking at my box plot it looks like the skill players are doing way more push ups than the line players. 

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
favstats(pushups~position,data=mydata)
```

It looks like the skill players are doing way more push ups than the line players. The average amount of push ups the line players did was 17 and the skill players is roughly 50 push ups. 

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly. Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc. Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

```{r}
t.test(pushups~position,data=mydata)
```

If there is no difference between how many push ups a skill player and a line player can do is .000009421. This is a example of the difference between how many push ups a skill player can do rather than a line player statistically. 

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here. If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variables causes the other, or whether they perhaps are related for some other reason. Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->

Using helper file and analyzing the data , from what I gathered I the skill players have a better ability of doing more push ups than the line players. Also, I've learned about the box plot to help determine the amount of push ups players can do. Also, the t.test was applied and used frequently and it shows after the test is ran the results were .00000942.
